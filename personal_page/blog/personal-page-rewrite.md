## Good News!
---
Project that I have been working on for a while is finally finished. I am here with the new version of my personal page and the first blog post!

If we look at my old personal page, it was there just so you know that there is a site there. However, this time I decided to make a truly personal site. And, as always, I'm doing this open source to teach you something. [You can go to the project page by clicking here.](https://github.com/barbarbar338/webpage)

## What's New?
---
Well, I made lots of new things. *I won't show the transition effects, let the fun part be up to you.*

## Landing Page
